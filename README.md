# Arduino traffic light(and more)

### Parts:
- 3x 150 Î© Resistor.
- 3x 3v Led (Red, yellow and green).
- Arduino UNO.
- Breadboard (optional).
 
> [!NOTE]
> Connect pin 2 to the red, pin 3 to the yellow and pin 4 to the green. (Or change the pin int's in the start)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Dont forget the resistors, failiure to connect them can lead to the diode getting too much power and breaking.

> [!TIP]
> To change "mode" you can change the variables inside the parentheses to "on" or "off".
> ```C++
> void loop() {
>
>  trafficLight(on);
>  bounce(off);
>  refresh(off);
>}
